			<p>At the end of University I would have liked to have built my own multi-billion dollar business from a system I created. If that doesn't workout then as long as I have enough money to live comfortably then I would have been satisfied with career output. I have no intentions of working for anyone, but if i should this is what you should know.If your ever felt your business was lacking its because you didn't have me, <strong>Alex</strong>. I am the sugar that your company needs to fuel it with sucess. My overall career goal is to cause a great positive impact not only on my life, but others using technology.</p>
